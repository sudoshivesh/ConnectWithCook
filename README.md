# ConnectWithCook - **Connecting You to Home-Cooked Happiness** 

## About the Project

**ConnectWithCook** is a website designed to bridge the gap between people living in flats or rooms in Greater Noida and the cooks who can provide them with home-cooked meals. Our platform allows students, working professionals, and anyone in need to easily find and connect with cooks in their sector. Unlike other websites, we are not mediators; we simply provide the contact details so users can negotiate and customize their plans directly with the cooks.

The website's simple and intuitive GUI ensures that anyone can use it without hassle. Our future scope includes expanding our database to include other service providers like maids, home keepers, electricians, plumbers, and more, catering to the daily needs of students and working professionals.

## Features

- **Direct Connection**: Provides contact details of cooks without acting as a mediator.
- **Easy Contribution**: Visitors and cooks can easily get added to our database by filling out a contribution form.
- **Verification**: We ensure all entries are verified before adding them to our database.
- **Future Expansion**: Plans to add profiles of other essential service providers.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, Vanilla JavaScript
